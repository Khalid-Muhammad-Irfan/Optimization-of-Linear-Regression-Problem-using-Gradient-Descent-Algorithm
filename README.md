# Optimization-of-Linear-Regression-Problem-using-Gradient-Descent-Algorithm
As a part my PhD course project, I used Gradient Descent Algorithm to optimize a linear regression problem. 
The course presented the theoretical aspects needed to model, solve, and evaluate real-world problems by leveraging optimization techniques. It ended with a project using the proposed optimization techniques to formulate and solve an issue entitled “Optimization of Linear Regression Problem using Gradient Descent Algorithm problem.”
